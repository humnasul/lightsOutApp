# lightsOutApp
A basic lights out game made using Android Studio for Mobile App Design.  
Uses Android Studio, Java, app design, and basic graphic design  
Includes all source files + zip file of all source files for importing  
The actual code is included at directory lightsOutApp\LightsOut\app\src\main\java\com\example\lightsout  
I did extra credit for this assigment - it was included in MainActivity.java in the source files, but is also included in a PDF (extraCredit_code.pdf) for convenience  
The app works in both portrait and landscape modes!!  
BASIC DESCRIPTION: Lights Out is a puzzle game where you try to turn on or off ALL the lights on a 3x3 grid. When the game starts, all of the lights are switched off. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the adjacent lights. The goal is to switch all the lights on or off, preferably with as few button presses as possible.  
You can switch the color of the light you are playing with and you can always start a new game :) Have fun!
