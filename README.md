# lightsOutApp
A basic lights out game made using Android Studio for Mobile App Design.  
Uses Android Studio, Java, app design, and basic graphic design  
Includes all source files + zip file of all source files for importing  
The actual code is included at directory lightsOutApp\LightsOut\app\src\main\java\com\example\lightsout  
I did extra credit for this assigment - it was included in MainActivity.java in the source files, but is also included in a PDF (extraCredit_code.pdf) for convenience  
The app works in both portrait and landscape modes!!
